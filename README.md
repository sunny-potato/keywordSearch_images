## Features

## What I have tried in this project

- Create responsive drawing image "Camera" with CSS in the main page
  I use aspect-ratio in CSS which maintains the form of image when resized.
- Use CSS Selectors
  I use CSS selectors to make filtering function in Javascript as well as CSS.
  It seems complicated in the code, but good to learn its rule.
